- Secure boot
- Secure kernel (`securekernel.exe`)
  - Device Guard
    - Hypervisor-based Code Integrity (HVCI)
    - Kernel-Mode Code Integrity (KMCI)
  - Credential Guard
    - LSA (`Lsass.exe`)
    - Isolated LSA (`LsaIso.exe`)
- Isolated user mode (`Iumdll.dll` and `Iumbase.dll`, the VTL 1 version of `Ntdll.dll` and `Kernelbase.dll`)
  - Trustlets

## Credential Guard
Credentials:
- Password
- NT one-way function (used by the NT LAN Manager protocol)
- Ticket-granting ticket (used by the Kerberos protocol)

## Performance impacts
VBS can cause performance drops of 5% to 30%.[^pcgamer][^toms]

## Configuration
[^ms-integrity][^ms-credential]
- `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control`
  - DeviceGuard
    - EnableVirtualizationBasedSecurity
    - RequirePlatformSecurityFeatures
    - Scenarios
      - HypervisorEnforcedCodeIntegrity
      - CredentialGuard
  - Lsa
    - LsaCfgFlags
- Group Policy (`gpedit.msc`)
  - Computer Configuration/Administrative Templates/System/Device Guard
    - Turn on Virtualization Based Security
      - Select Platform Security Level (Secure Boot and DMA Protection)
      - Virtualization Based Protection of Code Integrity
      - Credential Guard Configuration

To disable VBS without disabling Hyper-V, run the following commands after turning off all VBS Group Policy and registry settings[^ms-credential][^disable-ms-qa][^disable-su]:
```cmd
mountvol X: /s
copy %WINDIR%\System32\SecConfig.efi X:\EFI\Microsoft\Boot\SecConfig.efi /Y
bcdedit /create {0cb3b571-2f2e-4343-a879-d86a476d7215} /d "Disable VBS" /application osloader
bcdedit /set {0cb3b571-2f2e-4343-a879-d86a476d7215} path "\EFI\Microsoft\Boot\SecConfig.efi"
bcdedit /bootsequence {0cb3b571-2f2e-4343-a879-d86a476d7215}
bcdedit /set {0cb3b571-2f2e-4343-a879-d86a476d7215} loadoptions DISABLE-VBS
bcdedit /set vsmlaunchtype off
bcdedit /set {0cb3b571-2f2e-4343-a879-d86a476d7215} device partition=X:
mountvol X: /d
```
However, while `bcdedit /bootsequence` works, `bcdedit /default` does not, which means we can only disable VBS for the next boot. A workaround is to use Task Manager to run `bcdedit.exe /bootsequence {0cb3b571-2f2e-4343-a879-d86a476d7215}` after every boot.

At boot you should see the "Virtualization Based Security Opt-out Tool" asking you whether to disable VBS. Press Win or F3 to continue and reboot to the real system.
